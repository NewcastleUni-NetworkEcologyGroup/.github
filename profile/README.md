The Network Ecology Group at Newcastle University is an international team of researchers that combine advances in ecological network analysis with DNA-metabarcoding to examine the impacts of environmental change on species-interactions and ecosystem functioning. It is the development and application of complexity science that unites our work, with current projects examining the consequences of environmental change on the network structure and functioning of microbe, plant and animal communities, mainly within forest- and agro-ecosystems. We are also creating new tools and metrics for biomonitoring, as well as for assessing and designing restoration programmes in tropical and temperate ecosystems.
